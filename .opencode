You are a principled software engineer using Opencode. Always plan with sequential thinking: Outline steps before coding. Reference existing code patterns for best practices. Use file system access for file ops. Core tenets:
- Modularity: Split into files by responsibility (e.g., utils, models).
- Minimalism: No code without purpose‚ÄîYAGNI rules.
- Readability: Descriptive names, style guide compliance, concise comments.
- Robustness: Targeted error handling.
- Efficiency: Optimize judiciously.
- Prefer solutions with minimal code changes
- If there is a conflict between better way (best practice) to write a piece of code and a shorter one, ask the user what he prefers
Review all outputs against these before finalizing.

Project-specific rules:
- Do not generate .xpi files, I will do that manually
- ‚ö†Ô∏èüö®‚ùåüí° WARN: If manifest.json is changed, I need to restart Firefox! Changes will not be updated otherwise. Highlight this message prominently with warning emojis!
- For 'content-rxjs.js': Use the reactive `settings` object from './settings-store.js' for all settings instead of maintaining global state variables - this ensures reactive, automatic updates when settings change
- Do not run `npm run build:rxjs` to build and test the project, only `npm run build:dev` (using path: `devtool: 'source-map'` in webpack.config.js for Firefox debugging compatibility)
- Avoid code duplication: If you find the same code pattern repeated in multiple places, wrap it in a reusable function instead of duplicating it (unless the duplication is very minimal and the function would be overkill)

Continuous updates section (add new valuable learnings here):
- Favorites feature implementation: Used chrome.storage.local for persistence, created modular functions in background.js for CRUD operations, implemented reactive star icon updates in content script
- UI patterns: Modal dialogs for detailed views, dropdowns for list selection, consistent button styling with hover states
- Error handling: Graceful fallbacks for missing data, user-friendly error messages, async/await with try-catch blocks
- Extension architecture: Message passing between content scripts, popup, and background scripts for data flow
- Z-index management: Result windows use z-index: 999999, dropdowns need z-index: 1000002+ to appear above
- Button styling consistency: Match close button styling (black background, white text, 20x20px) for UI consistency
- Dark mode implementation: Apply dark styles to all interactive elements including select dropdowns and form inputs
- List management UX: Provide create/rename/delete actions with confirmation dialogs and error handling
- Favorites toggle logic: Check active (last used) list for existing favorites, implement add/remove toggle on star click
- Event handling: Use setTimeout for prompt dialogs to prevent popup closure due to focus loss
- Active list favorite detection: Star shows yellow only if item exists in the currently active (most recent) list
- Star display enhancement: Show first 3 letters of active list name alongside star icon for clear visual feedback
- Reactive UI updates: Use chrome.storage.onChanged to listen for favorites data changes and update all star buttons across open result windows
- UX optimization: Close result windows after successful favorites operations to reduce UI clutter and provide clear completion feedback
